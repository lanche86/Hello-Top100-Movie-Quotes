Hello Top 100 Movie Quotes
=========

This plugin is based and in code pretty much the same with Hello Dolly plugin, and since I am movie freak, this is my paying homage to all those awesome movies. The second functionality of this plugin: It hides Hello Dolly via CSS :) Quotes taken from: http://www.imdb.com/list/nnZKWPzNk5A/


## Installation

###The YOLO Way (not available yet)
1. In your WordPress Admin, go to the Add New Plugins page
2. Search for: hello top100 movie quotes
3. It should be the first result. Click the Install link.


###The Old-but-Gold Way
1. Upload the plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


Protip: This plugin hides Hello Dolly (#dolly) via CSS, if you have Hello Dolly and you still wanna enjoy it, just edit this plugin (line 142 hides the Dolly).

Other than that, nothing special. If you have any ideas, comments, feel free to contribute.
